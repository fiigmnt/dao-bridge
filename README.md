# DAO Bridge üåÅ

>it's probably nothing

## TL;DR

A discord bot built to allow cross server communication.  ‚ú®

## How it Works

1. Add the bot to your server and a new channel will be created `#dao-bridge`
2. When a user messages in that channel, their message will populate to other servers that have the bot
3. Your community can gate this content or build further from here ü§ô

## Setup

1. Fork the repository to your gihub account (top right hand corner)
2. Clone the fork to your local system
3. Install Node modules `npm install`
4. Run with the following process variables:
   `DISCORD_TOKEN` :point_right:  token for the bot (created in developer portal)
   `CONNECTION` :point_right: prisma connection to your db üçÑ

## Submitting your improvements

1. Create a new branch `git check -b <your branch name>`
2. `git add .`
3. `git commit -m 'fix(example): semantic versioning is cool'`
4. `git push`
5. Grab that PR and point it to our main branch
6. Message with changes for a review ! :v:
